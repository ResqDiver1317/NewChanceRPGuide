Welcome to the New Chance Roleplay Documentation Guide!
===================================

New Chance Roleplay is a public FiveM community that strives to achieve serious roleplay while still having
fun with our fellow community members. From the developer standpoint, we work hard to add as many things as
we can to enhance the roleplay experience. For the end user, aka you the player, this can often result in 
having to remember many commands, keybinds, and actions. We are working hard to simply as much of this as we
can to ensure ease of access for everyone. 

One of the things you will see mentioned throughout much of this guide is the reference to Ox_Target or 
Third Eye. Ox_Target is an interaction script that allows you to hold `left alt` and on anything that can 
be interacted with you will see a white eye and some options. Clicking your mouse once will allow your 
mouse to unlock so you can click the menu items to trigger actions. If all you see is a black eye, that 
means you are not looking at something that can be targetted which could mean either the object just cannot 
be targetted or you may need to move closer. If you see in this documentation anything that references 
Third Eye, Ox_Target, or simply OT, these are all references to the same thing. 
OT is simply Ox_Target being abbreviated for the ease of writing this guide and Third Eye is a common nickname
for a series of scripts, including Ox_Target, that all provide a similar interaction function.
